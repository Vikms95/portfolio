<!-- Ideas -->
- Make camera move to a part of the solar system when looking at certain position

- Give random lights to the Sun so it looks like plasma explosions

- Make the bio float and the rest of the content rest on a semi-transparent div

- Make some drawing follow your cursor as with:
https://itssharl.ee/fr

- I like the projects layout from this portfolio:
https://brittanychiang.com/

- Make the social media sidebar also look like the portfolio above and create some kind of futuristic layout as if you were an astronaut

- Webpage for icons:
https://www.flaticon.com/

- Add bluriness to the content div

- Tech icons
