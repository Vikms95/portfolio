<!-- Ideas -->

- Make camera move to a part of the solar system when looking at certain position

- Give random lights to the Sun so it looks like plasma explosions
<!-- Gave it PointLights generated randomly -->
Need to give it animations on the Sun texture itself
<!--
- Make the bio float and the rest of the content rest on a semi-transparent div -->

- I like the projects layout from this portfolio:
  https://brittanychiang.com/

- Make the social media sidebar also look like the portfolio above and create some kind of futuristic layout as if you were an astronaut

- Logo

<!-- - Add description and intersects to planets -->
